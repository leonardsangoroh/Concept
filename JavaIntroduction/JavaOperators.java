        1. Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %)
        
        2. Assignment (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)

        3. Relational operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)

        4. Java logical operators (&&, ||, !)

                            (+, -, ++, --, !)
        
        6. Bitwise operators -> used to perform oprations on individual bits
                             -> didn't find them as a necessary concept
